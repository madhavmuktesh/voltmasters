            How Does it Work?
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_article_width/public/2021-07/hfto-electrolyzer-illustration.png?itok=s8WlBKKg" alt="">
        <p class="data">
            Like fuel cells, electrolyzers consist of an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte. Different electrolyzers function in different ways, mainly due to the different type of electrolyte material involved and the ionic species it conducts.
        </p>
        <p class="h2">
            Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrolyzers
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            In a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the electrolyte is a solid specialty plastic material.
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            &gt &gt Water reacts at the anode to form oxygen and positively charged hydrogen ions (protons).
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            &gt &gt The electrons flow through an external circuit and the hydrogen ions selectively move across the PEM to the cathode.
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            &gt &gt At the cathode, hydrogen ions combine with electrons from the external circuit to form hydrogen gas. Anode Reaction: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e- Cathode Reaction: 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2
        </p>
        <p class="h2">
            Alkaline Electrolyzers
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            Alkaline electrolyzers operate via transport of hydroxide ions (OH-) through the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode with hydrogen being generated on the cathode side. Electrolyzers using a liquid alkaline solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte have been commercially available for many years. Newer approaches using solid alkaline exchange membranes (AEM) as the electrolyte are showing promise on the lab scale.
        </p>
        <p class="h2">
            Solid Oxide Electrolyzers
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            Solid oxide electrolyzers, which use a solid ceramic material as the electrolyte that selectively conducts negatively charged oxygen ions (O2-) at elevated temperatures, generate hydrogen in a slightly different way.
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            &gt &gt Steam at the cathode combines with electrons from the external circuit to form hydrogen gas and negatively charged oxygen ions.
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            &gt &gt The oxygen ions pass through the solid ceramic membrane and react at the anode to form oxygen gas and generate electrons for the external circuit.
        </p>
        <p class="data">
            Solid oxide electrolyzers must operate at temperatures high enough for the solid oxide membranes to function properly (about 700°–800°C, compared to PEM electrolyzers, which operate at 70°–90°C, and commercial alkaline electrolyzers, which typically operate at less than 100°C). Advanced lab-scale solid oxide electrolyzers based on proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes are showing promise for lowering the operating temperature to 500°–600°C. The solid oxide electrolyzers can effectively use heat available at these elevated temperatures (from various sources, including nuclear energy) to decrease the amount of electrical energy needed to produce hydrogen from water.

            Why  To Choose VOLTMASTERS?
        </p>
        <p class="wel">
           <span class="spanintro">Sea Water Electrolysis:</span> 
Unlike traditional EVs that rely on grid electricity or fossil fuels for power, our vehicles utilize sea water electrolysis. This process involves breaking down water molecules from the ocean, extracting hydrogen gas, and using it as a clean and renewable energy source to propel our cars.
        </p>
        <p class="wel">
           <span class="spanintro"> Environmental Benefits:</span>
By harnessing sea water electrolysis, we significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Our EVs produce zero emissions during operation, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier planet for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p class="wel">
            <span class="spanintro">Abundant Resource:</span>
With nearly 71% of the Earth's surface covered by oceans, sea water is an abundant resource. By tapping into this virtually limitless supply, we can ensure a sustainable and uninterrupted source of clean energy for our EVs.
        </p>
